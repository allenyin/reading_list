Wiener filter --> multivariate linear regression. Both input and reference processes are WSS. Very important!

However, nearly two decades after Wiener’s
work, Rudolf Kalman developed the Kalman filter, which is the optimum mean
square linear filter for nonstationary processes (evolving under a certain state space
model) and stationary ones (converging in steady state to the Wiener’s solution)

UKF - Introduces two modifications to KF:
1) Allows nonlinear neuron tuning model -- nonlinear observation model, in this case, it's quadratic. Describes neuron tuning better (apparently).
2) Allows nonlinear movement model -- nonlinear state model.
3) n-degree movement model -- movement transition as a nonlinear model in terms of the past n states.

Why not use EKF? According to wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter#Unscented_Kalman_filter), 

When the movement and observation models "are highly non-linear, the extended Kalman filter can give particularly poor performance.[38] This is because the covariance is propagated through linearization of the underlying non-linear model. The unscented Kalman filter (UKF) [38] uses a deterministic sampling technique known as the unscented transform to pick a minimal set of sample points (called sigma points) around the mean. These sigma points are then propagated through the non-linear functions, from which the mean and covariance of the estimate are then recovered. The result is a filter which more accurately captures the true mean and covariance. "

The number of sigma points was chose to be 2d+1, where d=4n is the dimension of the state space. If n=10, then d=40 -- big state space!

Understand the concepts, have not gone through the math.
The name "unscented" is pretty dumb, the author named it after "unscented deodrant" he saw on his coworker's desk..stupid.

ReFIT-KF..?

[Brain-computer interfaces for dissecting cognitive processes underlying sensorimotor control](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095943881500183X)

Short review on how BCI can serve as a good platform for cognitive processes. Not much new information, but spells out the advatnage of BMI as a neuroscience platform in a lucid way. Include some good references.

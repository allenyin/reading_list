Mechanisms of limb stability:
*Antagonist muscle architecture produces an equilibrium point. *Polit and Bizzi* experiments with de-afferented monkeys showed passive properties can reach target, but cannot resist pertubation very well.
*Passive, spring-like properties of limb promotes stability.
*CNS reflexes.
*Neuropathy - cannot sense location of limbs without vision.
*[*Mussa-Ivaldi*] shows stiffness of the arm remains roughly constant when expressed in terms of joint coordinates.

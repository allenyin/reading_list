[Using Reinforcement Learning to Provide Stable Brain-Machine Interface Control Despite Neural Input Reorganization](Using Reinforcement Learning to Provide Stable Brain-Machine Interface Control Despite Neural Input Reorganization)

Simple binary BMI-control demonstration with the RLBMI framework. Finally showed some neural data, and showed that the RLBMI approach is robust against neuron losss.
